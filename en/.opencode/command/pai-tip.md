# /pai-tip - Daily Learning Tip

> Your daily tip to use Personal AI better. 22 tips in 3 weeks.

## Your Task

1. **Read the progress** from `progress/tips.md`
   - Which tip was shown last?
   - When was it shown?

2. **Choose the next tip**
   - If no tip today: show the next in sequence
   - If user says `/pai-tip next`: skip to the next
   - If user says `/pai-tip [number]`: show that specific tip

3. **Read the tip** from `tips/`

   **File Mapping (Tip number → File):**
   ```

   ```

4. **Show the tip** in format:

```
Tip #[X] of 22 - [Category]

## [Title]

[Content of the tip]

---
Try it: [Concrete call to action to try it]

Next tip: /pai-tip (tomorrow) or /pai-tip next (now)
```

5. **Update the progress** (in the background)
   - Update `progress/tips.md` AFTER showing the tip
   - Show the tip immediately - update is secondary

## When all 22 tips are done

```
You've completed all 22 tips!

You now know Personal AI inside and out. Time for the next step:
-> Create your first custom skill (see EXTENDING.md)

Tip archive: /pai-tip [1-22] to see a tip again
```

## ALWAYS
- Show the tip IMMEDIATELY - no tool outputs first
- Show only ONE tip per call
- Make the tip practical - always with "Try it"
- Keep tips short and actionable

## NEVER
- Never show multiple tips at once
- Don't skip tips automatically
