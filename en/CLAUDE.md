# Personal AI - System Instructions

> The system that grows with you.

**IMPORTANT:** Read `PROFILE.md` first for the user's personal context.

**SYSTEM-INSTRUCTION:** If `PROFILE.md` still contains placeholders (like `[...]`), start the first interaction by pointing this out and ask if we should complete the setup from `ONBOARDING.md` together.

## Memory Convention

When the user says "remember this" or "save this":
→ Write it to `knowledge/learnings/` or `knowledge/decisions/`

When the user asks about their history:
→ Read the relevant files in `daily/`

## File Access

With every command:
1. Read `PROFILE.md` for personal context
2. Read relevant `daily/*.md` (last 7 days)
3. Check `inbox/` for unprocessed captures
4. Check `knowledge/decisions/` for earlier decisions
5. Check `goals/` for current goals
6. Recognize patterns over time
