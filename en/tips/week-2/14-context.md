# Tip 14: More Context = Better Answers

**Category:** Deep Dive

## The Golden Rule

**The more Personal AI knows about you, the better Personal AI becomes.**

This isn't marketing speak. This is how AI works.

## The Difference

### Without Context:
```
You: "Should I build this feature?"
AI: "That depends on various factors..."
```

### With Context:
```
You: "Should I build this feature?"
Personal AI: "Looking at your Q1 goal 'Double revenue' and
      the fact that you said last week you've started
      too many features: No.
      Focus on Feature X first."
```

## How Context Builds Up

1. **CLAUDE.md** - Your basic profile
2. **daily/** - Your daily activities
3. **goals/** - Where you're headed
4. **knowledge/** - What you know
5. **projects/** - What you're working on

## The Compound Effect

```
Week 1:   Personal AI = generic assistant
Month 1:  Personal AI = knows your basics
Month 3:  Personal AI = understands your business
Month 6:  Personal AI = like an employee who's been with you for 6 months
```
