## Why a Knowledge Base?

Imagine you could give your employee a handbook:
- "This is how WE do things here"
- "These are our tools"
- "We already tried this (didn't work)"

That's your knowledge base for Personal AI.

## What Belongs In It?

- **Learnings:** "Email marketing works better for us than social"
- **Resources:** Links to your most important tools
- **Templates:** Email templates, meeting agendas, etc.
- **Decisions:** Important forks in the road

## Personal AI Uses This

With every research, every coaching, every text, Personal AI checks:
"Is there something relevant in the knowledge base?"
