# Tip 12: Write & Edit - Create Content with Personal AI

**Category:** Deep Dive

## Two Commands, Two Purposes

### /pai:write - New Content
```
/pai:write LinkedIn post about [topic]
```

Personal AI writes:
- In YOUR style (from CLAUDE.md)
- With YOUR context
- For YOUR target audience

### /pai:edit - Improve Existing Content
```
/pai:edit [text or file]
```

Personal AI:
- Checks structure and flow
- Cuts where possible
- Keeps your voice

## The Difference from ChatGPT

ChatGPT: Generic output for everyone.
Personal AI: Output that sounds like YOU.

Why? Because Personal AI:
- Knows your CLAUDE.md
- Has seen your previous texts
- Has learned your style

## Pro Tip

The more content you create with Personal AI, the better Personal AI gets at your style.
