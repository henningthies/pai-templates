# Tip 9: Define Goals in goals/

**Category:** Deep Dive

## Why Goals Matter

Personal AI reads your goals with almost every interaction:
- At standup: "Does this fit your goals?"
- With coach: "Looking at your goal X..."
- During research: Filters by relevance to your goals

Without defined goals, Personal AI is like an employee no one told where the journey is going.

## Structure

```
goals/
├── current.md      # Current focus goals (1-3)
├── quarterly.md    # Quarterly goals
└── someday.md      # Someday-maybe list
```

## Format for Goals

```markdown
## [Goal Name]
**Status:** active | paused | achieved
**Deadline:** [Date or "ongoing"]
**Why:** [1 sentence why this matters]
**Success Criteria:** [How do you know it's achieved?]
```

## Pro Tip

Less is more. 1-3 active goals. Personal AI will ask if you have too many at once.
