# Tip 7: Weekly Review - Reflect on the Week

**Category:** Basics

## Why Weekly Review?

The standup is daily. But once a week, you need the view from above:

- What did I REALLY accomplish this week?
- What patterns am I seeing?
- Is my direction still right?

## How It Works

```
/pai:review
```

Personal AI analyzes your entire week:
- All daily notes
- All completed tasks
- All open tasks
- Your captures and decisions

## What You Get

1. **Lookback:** What happened?
2. **Patterns:** What stands out? (too much X, too little Y)
3. **Wins:** What went well?
4. **Learnings:** What did you learn?
5. **Next Week:** What should be the focus?

## Pro Tip

Do the review on Friday afternoon or Sunday evening. Then you start Monday with a clear head.

Try it:

If you've been using Personal AI for a few days:
```
/pai:review
```

Otherwise: Set a reminder for the end of the week.
