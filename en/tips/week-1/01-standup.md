# Tip 1: Start Every Day with /pai:standup

**Category:** Basics

## Why This Matters

The standup is not just a check-in. It's the moment when Personal AI:
- Reads your yesterday's notes
- Recognizes open tasks
- Sees patterns ("This is day 3 for this task")

The more often you do standups, the better Personal AI knows your work style.

## How It Works

```
/pai:standup
```

Personal AI asks you:
1. What did you accomplish yesterday?
2. What are you committing to today?
3. What's blocking you?

And then gives you feedback based on your history.

Try it now:
```
/pai:standup
```

Do your first standup - even if you don't have history yet. Starting tomorrow, Personal AI will be smarter.
