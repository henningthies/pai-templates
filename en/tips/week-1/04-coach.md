# Tip 4: The Coach Has 3 Perspectives

**Category:** Basics

## What Makes This Special

When you use `/pai:coach`, you don't get ONE opinion - you get THREE:

### The Optimist
"This could work because..."

### The Pessimist
"This could fail because..."

### The Realist
"Based on your past experience..."

### The Synthesis
A balanced recommendation from all three perspectives.

## When to Use It

- Before important decisions
- When you're unsure
- When you need a sanity check
- When you're stuck

---

Try it now:

Think of a decision you're currently putting off:
```
/pai:coach Should I [your decision]?
```

The 3 perspectives help you see blind spots.
