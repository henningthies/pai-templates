# Tip 3: Your Daily Notes Are Personal AI's Memory

**Category:** Basics

## Why This Matters

Everything you discuss with Personal AI gets saved in `daily/[YYYY]-W[XX]/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (grouped by calendar week):
- Standups
- Completed tasks
- Decisions
- Thoughts

These files are Personal AI's **long-term memory**.

Without them, every session is a fresh start. With them, Personal AI knows more about your work after 2 weeks than many colleagues.

## The Folder

```
daily/
├── 2026-W02/
│   ├── 2026-01-06.md
│   ├── 2026-01-07.md
│   └── ...
└── 2026-W03/            <- current week
    ├── 2026-01-13.md
    └── 2026-01-14.md    <- today
```

Grouping by calendar week makes it easier to see an entire week at a glance.

## Pro Tip

You can also write or add to Daily Notes manually. Personal AI reads everything that's there.
