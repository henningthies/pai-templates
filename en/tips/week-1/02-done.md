# Tip 2: Close Tasks with /pai:done

**Category:** Basics

## Why This Matters

When you use `/pai:done`, more happens than just "checking off":

- Personal AI documents WHAT worked
- Personal AI remembers HOW LONG it took
- Personal AI learns your estimates vs. reality

After a few weeks, Personal AI can say: "Tasks like this usually take you 2 hours, not 30 minutes."

## How It Works

```
/pai:done Implemented login feature
```

Personal AI then asks:
- What worked well?
- What would you do differently?
- Are there follow-up tasks?

Try it now:

Think of something you completed today and close it out:
```
/pai:done [your completed task]
```
