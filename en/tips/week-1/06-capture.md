# Tip 6: Capture - Record Thoughts Instantly

**Category:** Basics

## The Problem

You have an idea. A thought. An insight.

But you're in the middle of something else. So you tell yourself "write it down later" - and forget it.

## The Solution

```
/pai:capture Could we solve Feature X with Approach Y?
```

Done. Personal AI:
- Saves the thought with timestamp
- Categorizes it automatically
- Brings it up again at the next review

## What to Use It For

- Ideas that come to you in the shower
- Questions you want to research later
- Micro-decisions you don't want to forget
- Feedback you received

## The Trick

Capture is FAST. No formatting, no thinking about where it belongs. Just get it out.
