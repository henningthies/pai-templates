# Tip 17: The Power of ALWAYS/NEVER

**Category:** Power User

## Why ALWAYS/NEVER?

AI models respond strongly to clear instructions. "ALWAYS" and "NEVER" are the strongest signals.

Vague: "Try to respond briefly"
Clear: "ALWAYS: Respond in maximum 3 sentences"

## Where to Use Them?

### In CLAUDE.md (global)
```markdown
## ALWAYS
- Respond in English
- Be direct, no small talk

## NEVER
- No emojis unless I ask for them
- No phrases like "Great!" or "Of course!"
```

### In Skills (skill-specific)
```markdown
## ALWAYS
- Read the last 7 daily notes first
- Show recognized patterns

## NEVER
- Make up data
- Never skip the memory check
```

## The Rule of Thumb

When you notice Personal AI repeatedly doing something "wrong":
-> Add an ALWAYS or NEVER rule

## Pro Tip

Collect your ALWAYS/NEVER rules over time. After 3 months, you have a system perfectly tailored to you.
