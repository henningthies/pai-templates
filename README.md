## What is Personal AI?

Personal AI transforms your AI CLI (Claude Code, OpenCode, or Gemini CLI) into a personal assistant that:

- **Knows you** - Your goals, projects, work style
- **Remembers** - What you worked on last week
- **Recognizes patterns** - "This is day 4 on this task"
- **Holds you accountable** - Without letting excuses slide
- **Grows with you** - More context = better assistance

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/henningthies/pai-templates.git ~/pai
   ```

2. Choose your language folder (`de` or `en`)

3. Run setup for your CLI:
